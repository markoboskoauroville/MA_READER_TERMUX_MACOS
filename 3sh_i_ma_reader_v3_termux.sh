# MA READER TERMUX  (Edge / Speechify)  -  installer for Termux   edition: v3
#
# repo: ma-reader-thermux
#
# v3 is the first version with two engines in it, and the first where the
# pause between words is an actual pause. It needs nothing new installed:
# the whole Speechify side is stdlib, so the dependency list is unchanged.
#
#
# THREE CONTROLS, NOT TWO
#
# The bar under the text used to carry speed and one pause. It carries three
# things now, arranged the way a hand wants them rather than the way they were
# added: the two pauses sit together on the left, because they are the same
# idea at two scales, silence between words and silence between sentences.
# Play stays in the middle. Speed is alone on the right.
#
# The right hand stepper used to say WORDS and did not really work. It says
# SPEED now. The pause between sentences, hidden in Settings since v26, is on
# the bar where it belongs, and it says SENTENCES.
#
#
# THE PAUSE BETWEEN WORDS IS A PAUSE NOW
#
# The old one changed playbackRate to race through the quiet the voice leaves
# between words. Every rate change was audible: clicks on the joins, chirping
# consonants, and on several Android webviews the audio muted outright below
# about a quarter speed. It was the wrong mechanism for the job.
#
# Rate is no longer touched anywhere on that path. The server already measures,
# once per clip, exactly where each between-word silence falls, using the same
# two-band envelope the word highlight is built on, and pulls each run inward
# by 18 ms at both ends so its edges are certainly quiet and never sit on the
# tail of an s or an f. The player now does the one honest thing available to
# it: inside one of those measured silences it PAUSES the mp3, waits the time
# you asked for, and plays it again. A pause inside silence cannot be heard.
# Nothing is re-recorded, nothing is resampled, no word is clipped, and no
# consonant is cut in half.
#
# It runs from 0.00 up to 2.00 seconds and no lower, because lengthening a
# silence is free while shortening one would mean cutting audio, and there is
# no way to have less silence than the voice actually recorded.
#
#
# TWO ENGINES
#
# Settings opens on two buttons, Edge and Speechify, and the cards below them
# follow whichever is chosen, so neither engine ever has to look at the other
# one's knobs. Speed, the two pauses, the text and the colours belong to both.
#
#   Edge      free, keyless, thirteen languages, two voices each. Its reported
#             word times are guesses, so every Edge clip is decoded after it
#             is made and every word re-pinned to the real waveform.
#
#   Speechify keyed, English only. It returns speech marks whose character
#             offsets land exactly on the text it was given and whose times
#             are measured from the audio it just made, so on this engine the
#             highlight needs no guessing at all.
#
# Speechify has no Croatian and no other Slavic voice, so the engine offers the
# two English accents and nothing else. Choosing one fills the four seats at
# the top of the reader with that accent's voices, two female and two male, in
# pairs. Four is the whole picker; there is no room for a fifth.
#
# The voice list is fetched by walking the cursor to the end rather than
# reading the first page. This matters: /v1/voices is paginated and defaults to
# fifty, and fifty alphabetically is all A names, which is one single British
# voice out of the thirty three that are really there.
#
#
# THE KEY RING, AND WHY IT IS LAZY
#
# One file, one key per line, with a name above each saying whose it is.
# Anything that is not sk_ followed by a long tail is read as a label, so a
# heading or a note in the file is never mistaken for a credential.
#
# Nothing is tested in advance. The obvious ring tests every key at startup and
# picks a winner, which with twenty keys spends twenty round trips to learn
# what it could have learned by simply trying. This one takes the first key not
# already known to be dead and just uses it. Only when a real request comes
# back 401 or 403 is that key condemned - written to a dead list on disk,
# permanently - and only then does the ring roll forward and repeat the very
# sentence that failed. A dead key costs one wasted request in its whole life,
# and a healthy ring costs none at all.
#
# The dead list survives restarts, so a revoked key is never paid for twice.
# Settings shows it, named and dated, with two ways out: Retry, which clears
# the mark in case an account was only suspended, and Remove, which strikes the
# key out of the file for good.
#
# 429 is not condemnation. A throttled key is valid, so it is stood down for a
# few minutes and tried again rather than thrown away, and a key is never
# blamed for the network being down.
#
# Keys are never printed, never logged, and never sent back to the browser.
# Nothing but the first six and last four characters is ever shown, and the
# dead list stores a SHA-256 fingerprint rather than the key, so that file can
# be read by anyone and gives up nothing.
#
#
# WHAT CAME BEFORE
#
# v26 split the gap in two, because it was never one thing.
#
# The knob on the player called GAP moved the silence between one sentence and
# the next. That is a real setting and it stays, but it is not the silence you
# notice while you are actually listening. The one you notice is the quiet
# INSIDE a sentence, between one word and the next, and there was no way to
# touch it. So there are two now. The gap between sentences moved into
# Settings, under Playback, where a set-once setting belongs. The right hand
# stepper on the player, beside play, is now the gap between WORDS.
#
# It does not re-record anything. The voice has already spoken the sentence
# with its pauses baked into one clip, and building a new clip per setting
# would cost a synthesis and would break the immutable cache the flow depends
# on. Instead the server measures, once per clip, exactly where the quiet
# between words falls, using the same two-band envelope the word highlight is
# built on, so a fricative tail is never mistaken for silence. The player then
# crosses that quiet differently: below zero it runs fast through it, above
# zero it stops inside it and waits. Speech is never touched at any setting, so
# no word is clipped and no consonant is cut in half. Clips cached before v26
# get their map measured once, on first touch, with no re-synthesis.
#
# v25 is a handful of small things that were wrong in the hand rather than on
# paper, plus a settings sheet you can navigate by colour.
#
# Tap the number. Speed and the gap sit between a minus and a plus on the player,
# and holding a button travels a long way quickly, which left no cheap way
# back. The number between them is a button now: tapping it returns that
# control to its resting value, 1.00 for speed and 0.00 for the gap.
#
# The swipe was backwards. Dragging left moved forwards, which reads as the
# text sliding the wrong way under the finger. Dragging RIGHT now brings the
# next sentence in from the right, the way a hand turns a page, and dragging
# left goes back. Anyone who had learnt the old direction can put it back with
# Reverse swipe in Settings, remembered like everything else.
#
# Settings are five cards instead of eight bare headings, each tinted and
# edged in its own colour so the block you want is findable by colour before
# you have read a word of it: Playback green, Text orange, Colour purple,
# Voices blue, Advanced teal. Text now holds letter size, line spacing and
# typeface together; Colour holds the page theme and the whole word highlight
# section. The order inside is still how often a thing is touched, not how
# important it sounds.
#
# v24 closed the seam between sentences, and moved speed and gap onto the
# player itself.
#
# The reading used to catch between one sentence and the next, which is fatal
# to a train of thought. Three separate causes were stacked on top of each
# other. The prefetch fetched each clip ahead of time and then threw the bytes
# away, trusting the browser cache to still hold them, while the audio route
# sent no Cache-Control at all, so the browser cached heuristically and often
# revalidated: a round trip of unpredictable length between every pair of
# sentences. The player then reused the same audio element, so setting src
# forced a fresh load and decode before the first sample. And the advance
# waited on the browser's 'ended' event, which arrives late by an amount that
# differs on every clip. That last one is what the ear reads as the break.
#
# All three are gone. Fetched clips are kept as blob URLs, so src touches no
# network and no disk. Three sentences are held ready at all times rather than
# two. There are three audio elements instead of two, one speaking and one
# holding the next sentence already decoded, so the handover is a swap and a
# play() on the same tick. And the handover is made by us, a hair before the
# clip ends, rather than waited for. Measured on a two second clip under a
# virtual clock: sentence starts now fall 1960 ms apart at gap zero, exactly
# the clip length minus the 40 ms lead, on every step including the first.
#
# The gap now runs into the minus, down to a whole second. A negative gap is a
# real overlap: the next sentence begins that much before the current one has
# finished and the two clips speak together, which closes the seam completely.
# Verified as two elements sounding at once. If a clip is genuinely slow to
# arrive the early handover simply does not fire and the old 'ended' path
# carries the run, so nothing stalls and nothing is skipped.
#
# The four outer transport buttons are replaced by two controls, one either
# side of play: speed on the left, gap on the right, each a minus, the number
# and a plus. Both step in twentieths so a press is a nudge, and both repeat
# while held. A double tap in the middle of the page now opens immersive
# reading and starts speaking; a double tap in the same place closes it and
# pauses, so you stop where you were reading. Settings are reordered with the
# most used first. The server picks the first free port at or above 8081 and
# writes it to a portfile, and o opens the page from the terminal.
#
# v23 rebuilt the timing measurement and adds a quick-turnaround workflow.
#
# One real bug first. edge-tts 7.x changed the default boundary type from
# WordBoundary to SentenceBoundary, so on any current install the app was
# receiving no word events at all and every clip was falling back to spreading
# words evenly across the audio. synth_unit now asks for WordBoundary
# explicitly, with a fallback for older edge-tts.
#
# Then the timing itself. Measured against hand-checked word onsets on a
# 15-clip, 6-language corpus, v22 put the highlight 50 ms late on average and
# up to 190 ms late on words starting with s, sh or f. The cause: a word was
# being pinned to its loudest moment, which is the vowel, not to where it
# actually starts. Three changes fix it. The envelope is now measured in two
# bands, broadband plus a pre-emphasised band that makes fricatives visible, at
# 16 kHz on a 5 ms hop instead of 8 kHz on 10 ms. Every detected onset is then
# walked back down its own energy slope to the foot of the rise. And the anchor
# solver's skip price went from 0.18 to 0.35, so a measured onset is no longer
# thrown away in favour of a badly placed engine guess. Result on the same
# corpus: RMS error 80 ms -> 18 ms, a 77% reduction, and the systematic
# lateness is gone (+50 ms -> -7 ms). Old cached clips upgrade themselves once,
# on first touch, with no re-synthesis, under the new engine tag "pcm2".
#
# Workflow: paste now reads. The Paste button, and the new P shortcut, replace
# whatever was in the box and start playing immediately, so a new text is one
# keystroke. Clicking or tapping a sentence jumps there and reads from it;
# clicking the sentence already playing pauses it. A mouse drag across the text
# moves a sentence, the same gesture as a touch swipe, so previous/next is
# reachable without a touchscreen. The timing nudge slider now steps in 5 ms
# instead of 20 ms and reads out in milliseconds.
#
# v22 shows the gap between sentences as a bare number, nothing else: no unit,
# no word at zero, just the figure.
#
# v21 is mostly about the silence between sentences. The old prefetch built a
# throwaway Audio element that the browser was free to collect before it ever
# finished loading, and it only ever looked one sentence ahead, so the player
# often sat waiting while the next sentence was still being synthesised. Now
# each sentence is fetched properly and kept, the reader runs two sentences
# ahead of itself, and it starts warming the opening sentences the moment a text
# is loaded, so playback should flow without stalling.
#
# The transport changes with it. The left button is now Home: it jumps back to
# the first sentence instead of stepping back one. Tapping the text pauses and
# resumes rather than jumping to that sentence, and moving between sentences is
# a swipe: left for the next one, right for the previous. The gap between
# sentences is now a plain 0 to 3 seconds in Settings, in tenths, so you can
# find the spacing that suits you.
#
# v20 adds a fourth RGB colour: the default reading font colour, the plain text
# of the reader when nothing is highlighted. Like the other three it is typed as
# R, G and B from 0 to 255. Left alone it follows the theme, so it stays right
# in night, sepia and day; type your own values to override it everywhere, and
# an Auto button hands it back to the theme whenever you want.
#
# v19 simplifies the highlight settings to three plain RGB colours you type by
# hand. Under Word highlight there are now three rows, each with an R, G and B
# box you fill from 0 to 255: the sentence highlight background, the word
# highlight background, and the font colour of the highlighted word. The
# sentence's own text stays readable on its own (light or dark is chosen for
# you from the colour you enter), and a live sample shows a highlighted word
# inside a highlighted sentence so you see all three at once. Remembered across
# themes; the old colour, intensity and font chips are gone.
#
# v18 adds a font colour to the word highlight, sitting right beside the colour
# and intensity rows. You can now set the highlighted word's own letters to
# white, middle grey or black, independently of the background behind them. The
# live sample updates as you choose, so you can dial in a pairing you like.
#
# v17 lets you dress the highlighted word to taste. In Settings, under Word
# highlight, there are now two little rows: a base colour (red, yellow or grey)
# and an intensity (muted, middle or screaming). The colour is the background
# that sits behind the word as it is spoken; muted is a soft tint, middle is a
# firmer wash, and screaming is a full solid block with readable text on top. A
# small live sample shows the pairing before you leave the sheet. Whatever you
# pick is remembered, and it holds across all three themes.
#
# v16 restyles the player controls in the flat, monochrome spirit of the Tidal
# transport bar. The controls are now solid filled icons on no background: the
# play and pause is the brightest, a clean white triangle and two rounded bars;
# the previous and next are the classic filled triangle with a bar; and the
# outer full screen and last controls sit dimmer, the way Tidal keeps shuffle
# and repeat quieter than the middle. No circles, no coloured fill, just a calm
# grey to white hierarchy that reads at a glance.
#
# v15 cleans up the top and the transport, and lets the picker be empty. A bare
# X sits next to Help; tapping it closes whatever is playing, wipes the current
# text and drops you back to a fresh paste box. The gear and the X are now plain
# icons with no circle around them. The two sentence skip controls beside the
# play button lost their coloured fill and are now simple hollow arrows on no
# background. And in Settings you may now untick every language: with zero
# languages the voice strip at the top disappears entirely, and the reader just
# uses the last voice you picked, remembered quietly in the background.
#
# v14 tidies the language list down to real languages only. The borrowed
# "Dalmatian", "Istrian" and "Sanskrit" language buttons are gone; instead the
# languages that can stand in for them now carry a plain "Can be used for:" line
# in the Settings language list. Croatian shows "Can be used for: Dalmatian,
# Čakavština", and Hindi (now a real language of its own, Swara and Madhur)
# shows "Can be used for: Sanskrit". So the picker only ever offers genuine
# neural voices, and the dialect uses are written underneath the voice that
# reads them. Thirteen languages, twenty six voices.
#
# v13 opens the reader to many more languages. Fifteen language groups are now
# built in, each with two top tier neural voices, one female and one male, at
# the same quality as Sonia and Ryan for English or Gabrijela and Srecko for
# Croatian: Croatian, Dalmatian (cakavian), Istrian (cakavian), Bosnian,
# Serbian, Macedonian, Albanian, Slovenian, German, French, Italian, Tamil,
# Sanskrit and Spanish, alongside the original English. Because that is a long
# list, Settings now carries a full Languages panel with a checkbox per
# language; whatever you tick shows up as a voice button at the top of the
# reader, so the picker stays short and personal. Three of these have no native
# neural voice anywhere (Microsoft ships none for cakavian Croatian or for
# Sanskrit), so they use the closest engine: Dalmatian and Istrian read through
# the standard Croatian voice, and Sanskrit reads through the Hindi voice, which
# speaks Devanagari. Those three are marked as such in the Languages panel.
#
# v12 adds live keyboard control to the running server. Press q to quit at once
# with no Enter, or b to detach and keep serving in the background so you get
# your terminal back. The background copy holds its own wake lock and logs to
# ~/.maread-web/server.log.
#
# v11 replaces the word-highlight timing with a WAVEFORM ENGINE. The old way
# trusted the voice engine's reported word times, but those live on a different
# clock than the finished mp3 (encoder padding, pause stretching), so the red
# word drifted off the speech. Caption tools like DaVinci Resolve stay glued to
# the voice because they analyse the actual audio; v11 does the same: after
# every sentence is synthesized, the app decodes that clip with ffmpeg,
# measures where speech really starts, ends and rises after each pause, and
# pins every word to the real waveform. The players also run a smoothed clip
# clock, so the highlight lands on each word exactly as it is spoken, online
# and offline alike. Clips cached before v11 are repaired automatically the
# first time they are used, with no re-synthesis.
#
# v10 added Select / Delete-all management to the Archive and Offline lists.
# v9 made the offline reader speak one sentence-clip at a time. Exporting a
# text writes, into Downloads/MA Reader Audio:
#     name.txt         the plain text
#     name.json        the manifest (sentence list + per clip word timing)
#     name/ sNNNN.mp3  one small mp3 per sentence, played in order
#
# Optional Google Gemini key (added in Settings from a plain .txt file) can name
# and summarise texts for the archive. Only Gemini errors are ever shown.
#
# Install:  bash 3sh_i_ma_reader_v3_termux.sh        Run:  mareadweb
#           then open  http://localhost:8081  in any browser on the phone.

# ---------------------------------------------------------- hard reinstall --
# Installing over the top of a previous version was the wrong idea. A file that
# moved or got renamed between versions simply stayed behind, and worse, a
# server still running from the last install keeps serving the page out of the
# process that is already in memory, so the browser shows the old app and the
# update looks like it did nothing at all. That is exactly what happened.
#
# So installing now means: stop whatever is running, put the things worth
# keeping somewhere safe, delete the whole app folder, write it fresh, and put
# the kept things back. Keys and settings survive. Nothing else does.
#
# The library at ~/.maread is never touched by any of this. Texts and their
# clips live there and are not part of the app.

# things that must survive a wipe. Keys above all: typing them again every
# update is the kind of small friction that makes a person stop updating.
# NOT speechify_voices.json: that is a cache of the voice catalogue, it costs
# a single request to rebuild, and carrying a stale one across an update is
# how the picker got stuck showing four voices out of nine hundred.

MA READER WEB - Flask engine for the browser front end.

Same per-sentence engine as the terminal MA Reader: text is cleaned, split into
sentences, and each sentence is spoken by edge-tts into its own mp3 with word
timings. The browser plays those clips and drives the highlight, so the
highlighted sentence stays lit when playback is paused or stopped.

# ---------- languages & voices ----------
# Every language group ships exactly two Microsoft neural voices, one female
# and one male, at the same top tier as the English and Croatian pair the app
# started with. LANGS is the source of truth; VOICES (the flat id -> tuple map
# the rest of the engine already speaks) is derived from it below, keeping the
# original ids 1..4 and disk vkeys (ukF/ukM/hrF/hrM) untouched so nothing that
# was cached or saved before breaks.
#
# Only real languages appear here. Some voices can also stand in for a dialect
# or a related tongue that has no neural voice of its own; that is written as a
# plain "uses" line shown under the language in Settings, NOT as its own button.
#   Croatian -> also reads Dalmatian and Čakavština (same Latin letters, read in
#               standard Croatian pronunciation).
#   Hindi    -> also reads Sanskrit (Devanagari script; romanised IAST will not
#               read well).
#
# Each language: key, label, native name, an optional "uses" note, and
# (female, male) where each voice is (edge voice id, display name). "vkeys"
# pins the on-disk cache/id keys so ids and folders stay stable across versions.

# ---------- Speechify: the second engine ----------
# Edge and Speechify are two ways of turning the same sentence into the same
# kind of clip. Everything downstream - the per-sentence cache, the silence
# map the word pause rides on, the offline export - is identical. Two things
# differ, and both were confirmed against the live API rather than assumed:
#
#   1. Edge is free and keyless. Speechify is keyed, so the ring below exists.
#   2. Edge reports word times its own engine invented, which is why every Edge
#      clip is decoded afterwards and every word re-pinned to the waveform.
#      Speechify returns speech marks whose character offsets land exactly on
#      the text it was given - verified character-for-character - and whose
#      times are measured from the audio it just made. So on Speechify the
#      highlight needs no guessing at all.
#
# THE RING, AND WHY IT IS LAZY
#
# The obvious ring tests every key at startup and picks a winner. That is a
# waste: with twenty keys it spends twenty round trips to learn something it
# could have learned by simply trying. So this ring never tests speculatively.
# It takes the first key that is not already known to be dead and just uses it.
# Only when a real request comes back 401 or 403 is that key condemned - marked
# dead on disk, permanently - and the ring rolls forward to the next one and
# retries the same sentence. Steady state costs zero extra requests.
#
# A condemned key stays condemned across restarts, so a dead key is paid for
# exactly once, ever. The Settings sheet lists them and offers two ways out:
# Retry, which clears the mark in case the account was only suspended, and
# Remove, which strikes the key from the file for good.
#
# 429 is never condemnation. A throttled key is valid, so it is stood down for
# a few minutes and tried again later rather than thrown away, and a network
# failure is never blamed on the key at all.

# privileges. There are two ways to get those without root, both of which the
# phone's own Developer options provide, and both of which need doing once per
# reboot rather than once per lifetime:
#
#   Shizuku   an app that holds an ADB-started service and lends it out. Its
#             `rish` shell runs anything at shell privilege. Best route: it
#             survives Wi-Fi changes because the service is already running.
#
#   self-ADB  Termux's own adb connecting to the phone it is running on, over
#             Wireless debugging. Inside Termux the address is always
#             127.0.0.1, so only the port matters.
#
# Rather than guess which one this phone has, try them in order and remember

# press everywhere it exists, because it speaks to the media session itself

      <h2>How MA Reader works</h2>
      <p class="sub">MA Reader <span id="appVer">v3 &middot; Edge / Speechify</span></p>
      <p class="lead">MA Reader turns any text into speech and lights up each
        word as it is spoken. There are two ways to read.</p>

      <h3>Read (online)</h3>
      <p>Paste text and press Read it. The app speaks it sentence by sentence
        with the voice you pick and highlights the word being read. Everything
        you read is saved to your Archive so you can open it again.</p>

      <h3>How the highlight stays on the word</h3>
      <p>The timing does not trust the voice engine's reported clock, which is
        what used to make the red word drift off the speech. Instead, after a
        sentence is spoken the app decodes that very clip, measures where
        speech truly begins and ends and where it rises after every pause, and
        pins each word to the real waveform, the same idea caption tools like
        DaVinci Resolve use. During playback a smoothed clock follows the clip
        so the highlight moves with the voice, not in jumps. Clips made by
        older versions are repaired automatically the first time they play.</p>

      <h3>Offline reader</h3>
      <p>Open a text, choose a voice, then press Export. The app speaks each
        sentence into its own small <code>.mp3</code> clip inside a folder named
        after the text, and writes a plain <code>.txt</code> and a
        <code>.json</code> manifest beside it. The Offline tab reads that
        manifest and plays the clips one sentence at a time: it lights up the
        whole sentence, then plays that sentence's clip, then moves to the next.
        There is no long stitched file, so the highlight always stays on the
        sentence being read and never jumps ahead. Voices cannot be changed
        there because the clips are already made.</p>

      <h3>Where files live</h3>
      <p>Everything offline uses one folder, created automatically the first time
        you export: <code>MA Reader Audio</code> inside your Downloads. On
        Android that is <code>Downloads/MA Reader Audio</code>; on a Mac it is
        <code>~/Downloads/MA Reader Audio</code>. On Android, run
        <code>termux-setup-storage</code> once so the app can reach Downloads.</p>

      <h3>Fastest way to read something</h3>
      <p>Copy any text, come back to this page and tap <b>Paste</b>. The
        clipboard replaces whatever was here and starts reading immediately.
        Tap any sentence to read from there, tap the sentence that is playing
        to pause it, and swipe sideways across the text to step a sentence.</p>

      <h3>The player</h3>
      <p>Either side of the play button is a small control with a minus, a
        number and a plus. The left one is the speaking speed, the right one is
        the gap between <b>words</b>. Both move in twentieths, so one press is a
        small nudge rather than a jump; hold a button down and it repeats,
        quickening after a second. Tapping the number itself puts that control
        back where it started, 1.00 for speed and 0.00 for the word gap, so coming
        home from a long hold costs one tap.</p>
      <p>The word gap is the quiet the voice already leaves inside a sentence,
        between one word and the next. Nothing is re-recorded and no word is
        ever cut: below zero the player runs quickly through that quiet, above
        zero it stops inside it and waits. It is the one you reach for while you
        are actually listening, which is why it sits on the player.</p>
      <p>The gap between <b>sentences</b> is a different silence and lives in
        Settings, under Playback, because it is set once and left. It goes below
        zero, down to minus one second, and a negative gap there is an overlap:
        the next sentence starts that much before this one has finished, so
        there is no seam at all between them.</p>

      <h3>Swiping</h3>
      <p>Drag sideways across the text to move a sentence. Dragging to the
        right brings the next sentence in from the right, the way a hand turns
        a page, and dragging left goes back. If the opposite feels right to
        you, turn on <b>Reverse swipe</b> in Settings and it swaps.</p>

      <h3>Immersive reading</h3>
      <p>Double tap the middle of the page and everything except the text goes
        away, like an ebook, and it starts speaking. Double tap the middle again
        and the controls come back and it pauses, so you always stop exactly
        where you were reading. While immersive, a single tap anywhere pauses
        and resumes.</p>

      <h3>Why it does not stutter between sentences</h3>
      <p>Each sentence is its own small clip, so there is a join between every
        pair of them. Three sentences ahead are always fetched and kept in
        memory, the next one is loaded into a second player and left decoded and
        waiting, and the changeover is made a fraction before the current clip
        ends rather than after the browser gets round to reporting it. Nothing
        is fetched, opened or decoded at the moment of the handover, so the
        reading runs on without a break.</p>

      <h3>Gemini (optional)</h3>
      <p>If you add a Google Gemini API key, the app can name and one line
        summarise your texts so the archive is easy to skim. Word timing does
        not use Gemini at all: it is measured locally from the audio itself.
        To add the key, open Settings and choose a plain <code>.txt</code> file
        that contains only the key on its first line. The key is kept in the
        app folder and never shown again. You are only told if Gemini reports a
        problem, such as an expired key or a used up quota.</p>
      <p>The app always starts with the cheapest Gemini model and only steps up
        to a stronger one when a cheaper answer does not check out, so it spends
        as little as possible. Timing help uses the speech engine's own word
        marks as the truth and asks Gemini only to line the words up to them, it
        never invents times.</p>

      note in the file is never mistaken for a credential.
      <br><br>Keys are tried in file order and nothing is tested in advance.
      The first key that is not already known to be dead is simply used, and it
      keeps being used until a request comes back rejected. Only then is it
      marked dead, here, permanently, and only then does the ring roll on to
      the next one and repeat the sentence that failed. So a dead key costs one
      wasted request in its whole life, and a working ring costs none at all.
      A key that is merely rate limited is stood down for a few minutes rather
      than condemned, and a key is never blamed for the network being down.
      <br><br>The file is copied into the app folder and never leaves this
      phone. Nothing but the first six and last four characters of a key is
      ever shown, and the dead list stores a fingerprint rather than the key,
      so it gives up nothing at all.</div>

    <div class="langhint">All three of these are on the player itself now, so
      this card is only here for the times you want to set them without a text
      open. On the bar the two pauses sit together on the left, play is in the
      middle where it has always been, and speed is on the right.
      <br><br>The pause between WORDS is a real pause. The voice has already
      spoken the sentence into one clip with its own small silences between
      the words; the server measures exactly where those silences fall, and the
      player stops the clip dead inside one and starts it again after the time
      you asked for. Nothing is re-recorded, nothing is sped up or slowed down,
      and because the stop happens in silence rather than in speech, no word is
      ever clipped and no consonant is ever cut in half. That is why it only
      runs upward from zero: there is no way to have less silence than the
      voice actually recorded.
      <br><br>The pause between SENTENCES is space we make ourselves between
      one clip and the next, so it can go below zero as well. A negative value
      is a real overlap: the next sentence begins that much before this one has
      finished, which closes the seam completely.
      <br><br>Everything moves in twentieths, so a press is a nudge and a hold
      travels a long way; tap the number between the minus and the plus to send
      that control back where it started.

    <div class="langhint"><b>Floating paste button.</b> A round P that sits on
      top of everything. Drag it wherever your thumb lands and it stays there.
      Press it and the clipboard replaces whatever is loaded, goes full screen,
      and starts reading from the beginning.
      <br><br>In full screen it changes face to the full screen glyph and
      becomes the way out. Leaving pauses, going back in plays, because full
      screen and reading are the same thing here. So the whole loop is one
      thumb on one button: press to paste and read, press to come out, press
      to paste the next one.
      <br><br><b>If the address bar will not go away.</b> The full screen
      request hides it, but Chrome puts it back on any gesture it feels like,
      and that is not something a page can overrule. The cure is to install the
      app: Chrome menu, then Add to Home screen. Opened from that icon it runs
      in its own window with no browser interface at all, because there is no
      tab for a bar to belong to. Nothing else is as reliable.
      <br><br>If the browser refuses to hand over the clipboard, and some do,
      a box opens with the cursor already in it. Long press, choose Paste, and
      reading starts the moment the text lands. That path works in any browser
      ever made, because it is just a text field.
      <br><br><b>Tap text to paste.</b> On by default, and it is
      the whole point of the app for anyone reading one article after another.
      A tap anywhere on the text being read asks for the clipboard; Android
      shows its Paste button; you press it and the new text replaces the old
      one and starts speaking. One finger, two presses, no menus.
      <br><br>It costs the old tap gestures, which is why it is a switch.
      While it is on, tapping a sentence no longer jumps to it and the double
      tap in the middle no longer opens full screen, because a tap cannot mean
      three things at once. Play and pause live on the player, full screen has
      its own button beside the progress bar, and swiping still steps a
      sentence at a time. Turn it off to have the old taps back.</div>
    <div class="langhint"><b>Resume my music.</b> When this app speaks, Android
      hands it the audio focus and whatever else was playing stops at once, no
      fade, nothing to configure. That half is free.
      <br><br>Starting your music again afterwards is not free. A page in a
      browser cannot reach into another app, and neither can Termux by itself:
      Android only accepts a media command from a process holding shell
      privileges. Developer options can grant those without root, in two ways,
      and either one needs doing once per reboot.
      <br><br>Run <b>maread-adb</b> in Termux to set it up. It looks for
      Shizuku first, then for Termux's own ADB over Wireless debugging, and
      tells you which one your phone will accept. Then press Test here.
      <br><br>Once a route works it is remembered, so a pause costs one small
      command rather than a search. If the route later breaks, a Wi-Fi change
      or a reboot, the search runs again by itself and this switch turns off
      quietly rather than asking on every pause.
      <br><br>It sends the media session a real PLAY, not a play/pause toggle,
      so if your player already came back on its own this cannot knock it out
      again.</div>
    <div class="langhint">Swiping across the text moves a sentence. Normally
      you drag right to bring the next sentence in, the way a page turns.
      Reverse swipe flips that if the other way round feels right to you.</div>

      the phone happens to have set as default. Turn this off to go back to the
      phone's own choice.
      <br><br>If Chrome is not installed it falls back to the default anyway,
      and says so in the terminal rather than failing silently. Beta, Dev and
      Canary are all tried before giving up.
      <br><br>While the app is running, the terminal takes one key:
      <b>O</b> opens the page in Chrome, <b>A</b> opens it in the phone's
      default browser, and <b>Q</b> stops the server. Useful when a tab has

   simply muted below about a quarter speed. Rate is never touched now. The

   the player does the one honest thing: it PAUSES the clip inside a silence,
   waits the time you asked for, and plays it again. A pause in silence is
   inaudible by definition. Nothing is re-recorded, nothing is resampled, no
   word is clipped, no consonant is cut in half.
